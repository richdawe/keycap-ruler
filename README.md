# Keycap Ruler

Sometimes I find it hard to tell the exact size of a keycap, especially the larger ones that I don't use much. E.g.: 1.75U or 2.75U. There are "keycap rules" online, such as the excellent [Keycap Ruler by Zekth](https://zekth.github.io/keycap-ruler/). But I wanted a physical ruler I could use with keycap sets, to make my life easier.

The [keycap ruler](keycap-ruler.odt) in this repository can be printed onto a sheet of labels. Then the labels can be cut out and stuck onto the ruler. To make it easier to understand how many labels will fit per side on a ruler, I have a [spreadsheet with calculations](keycap-ruler.ods). E.g.: you can fit up to and including 2U labels on a 15 cm ruler with a 2 mm gap. (I have no tried longer rulers.)

Note that the keycap labels are designed to fit the specific adhesive labels I used (see below). The text boxes in the LibreOffice document are set to specific positions offset to the A4 page. You will need to adjust the document if you are using a different paper size, or different label sizes.

## What You Need

 * One or more rulers
 * A sheet of labels

I used these items. Note: Wilko is a general store in the UK, with reasonable prices and a good selection.
