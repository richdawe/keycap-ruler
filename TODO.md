Issues with v1:

 * Include 3U keycap length in information pane.

 * Change information pane to 2.25U so it will fit on the back of a 15 cm ruler.

 * Add a QR code link to the GitHub repo to the info pane?

 * Figure out why LibreOffice distorts the sizes of things when exporting to a PDF.
   * E.g.: 18 mm 1U -> 17 mm, which ruins the labels.

For v2:

 * Use wider labels, with keycap labels pre-arranged, to produce a neater result. E.g.: 15 cm wide with 1U-2U keycap shapes, which can be cut out and printed in one go and stuck on neatly.
 * Would this look better with transparent labels?
